# MHHabitat
```MHHabitat``` is a library used to differentiate between build configurations of an iOS application at runtime.  It accomplishes this by inspecting the ```embedded.mobileprovision``` file that the XCode toolchain includes during the application packaging process.  Common use cases include runtime toggling of api server endpoints, logging verbosity, access to In-App-Purchase assets, etc.

```MHHabitat``` supports detection of the following runtime environments:
* Development ```MHMobileProvisionTypeDebug```
* AdHoc ```MHMobileProvisionTypeAdHoc```
* Enterprise ```MHMobileProvisionTypeEnterprise```
* AppStore ```MHMobileProvisionTypeAppStore```

In the case that ```MHHabitat``` can't find or parse the ```embedded.mobileprovision``` file, it will default to ```MHMobileProvisionTypeAppStore``` in order to prevent any user-facing issues.  This holds true except when compiled for iOS Simulator (```TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR```), in which case a parsing failure will return ```MHMobileProvisionTypeUndetermined```.

## Usage
```objc
// Logging the current environment
NSLog(@"Current app environment is: %@", [MHHabitat mobileProvisionTypeString]);

// Toggle behavior based on environment
AFHTTPRequestOperationManager *manager;
if ([MHHabitat isAppProduction]) {
  manager = [[AFHTTPRequestOperationManager alloc] initWithBaseURL:@"http://myapi.com"];
}
else {
  manager = [[AFHTTPRequestOperationManager alloc] initWithBaseURL:@"https://dev.myapi.com"];
}
```
